<div>Hello,</div>
<div>
My name is Elizabeth Yoly Desir, Im 15 years old (soon to be 16), and first generation American in my family. I come from a long line of Haitians and carribean roots; therefore, culture is very important to me. Both my parents are from the small country known as Haiti, which makes up half of the island formerly known as Hispaniola. I have two older sisters, one who is 23 and another who is 21, both born on the island. I like to think that Iâ€™m the odd one of the bunch, as I am very creative, artsy, and curious when learning about new things; however, to me that simply adds a little spice to the family.

<h2>My Dream Goal:</h2>

I really want to pursue a career at a famous magazine company (like vogue), where I can include my interests of fashion, beauty, journalism, and code into one. I really want to go to university for journalism and computer science (possibly) and continue my path onwards to success. I also want to travel around the world with my career, and alone or with friends.
